- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Metrics for Evaluation used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall

- Decision tree is suitable to recall(yes)

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy Model in Prod**: You can deoloy model in Prod and continue the evaluation of model on varied dataset.
2. **Enhance Model Usage**: You should use other models like Random Forest to derive futher accuracy of model.
3. **Support Campaign using the data:** To make the more people subscribe, use this data to apply to identified age group, martial status, imcome groups.
